 # More information about Fibonacci https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

# Write a method that will return the nth number of the sequence.

# The syntax is easy, getting your head around the algorithm is the challenge.
# Write the sequence on a piece of paper first and think about the steps
# you take for each number. Translate this to pseudocode and then to ruby.

# Example:
# nthFibonacci(0) -> 0
# nthFibonacci(3) -> 2
# nthFibonacci(6) -> 8
